# ANJoYi Home Cooking

# Description

This is a group project from my first year at Oulu University of Applied Sciences. It is a simple website that allows users to look up recipes. Recipes can be found on this website by classifying food. I was primarily responsible for front-end and back-end development, as well as software architecture.
